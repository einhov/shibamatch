# Shiba Inu Match 64

This is a Shiba Inu-themed memory match game for the Nintendo 64.

The game is written for
[libn64](https://github.com/tj90241/n64chain/tree/master/libn64) and developed
with the [n64chain](https://github.com/tj90241/n64chain) by marathonm. The
Makefile and some initialisation code was taken from the helloworld example of
n64chain. The game has been tested with the [CEN64](https://cen64.com/)
emulator and on hardware with a [64drive](http://64drive.retroactive.be/).

## Thanks

To marathonm for libn64/n64chain, to marshallh for making the awesome 64drive
and to krom and others in #n64dev@EFnet for help.
